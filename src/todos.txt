TODOS: 

- create interface and typecheck for "coreBusinessData" in Auth service like user data

- rename confirm dialog to confirm-delete

- use [ngSrc] for avatar

- add createdAt values for clients and stuff

- remove/uninstall primeflex and remove any primeflex styles and only use scss for style. Dont get it confused with prime themeing system like p-text-secondary

- collapse the screen size vertically just to see if there are overflow issues (like sidebar). If so, add overflow scroll and make it seamless

- redesign toasts

- double check @if(s) to see if you can use @else if

- clean up styles.scss (make sure nested styles make sense) & remove fonts that are repated in divs. Try to rely on global font

- redesign register page

- redesign home page
