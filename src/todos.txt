TODOS: 

- fix bug when editing client and adding an image, form does not get marked as dirty

- add createdAt values for clients and stuff

- remove/uninstall primeflex and remove any primeflex styles and only use scss for style. Dont get it confused with prime themeing system like p-text-secondary

- implement session fetching to reduce # of reads per user (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED: Add Client, Edit Client, Delete Client, Fetch Business Data)

- check numberOfClients update in the datbase

- collapse the screen size vertically just to see if there are overflow issues (like sidebar). If so, add overflow scroll and make it seamless

- redesign toasts

- make dark/light mode based on a variable for the user in their firestore opposed to session state

- double check @if(s) to see if you can use @else if

- clean up styles.scss (make sure nested styles make sense) & remove fonts that are repated in divs. Try to rely on global font

- redesign register page

- redesign home page and add fade in

- download and load fonts locally instead of through google fonts API

- make 'images' folder in assets

- add join business feature for members who register for a business
